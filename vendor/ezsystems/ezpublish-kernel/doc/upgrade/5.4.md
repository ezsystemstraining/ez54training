# Upgrade steps to eZ Publish 5.4

## Update field sort keys for `ezstring` and `ezobjectrelationlist` field types

Note: you do not need to execute this if upgrading from 5.3.x version higher than 5.3.5
or from 5.4.x version higher than 5.4.2.

After activating `EzPublishMigrationBundle`, execute following commands from the installation root directory:

1. `php ezpublish/console ezpublish:update:legacy_storage_update_sort_keys ezstring`
2. `php ezpublish/console ezpublish:update:legacy_storage_update_sort_keys ezobjectrelation`

You can deactivate migration bundle after the commands are executed.
